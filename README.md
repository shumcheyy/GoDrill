## Slide 3: System Architecture

**Title**: High-Level Architecture  
**Content**:

- **Components**:
    - **Frontend**: HTML templates (login, account dashboard, transfer form).
    - **Backend API**: Go REST API (auth, accounts, transfers, payments).
    - **Database**: SQLite (secure storage of user and transaction data).
    - **Security Middleware**: WAF, rate limiting, logging, fraud detection.
    - **DevSecOps**: GitHub Actions (SAST, container scanning).
    - **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes/AWS.
- **Interaction**: Users access frontend, which calls API; API queries database; middleware enforces security.  
    **Visual**:
- Block diagram (see Flow Diagram below).
- Arrows showing user → frontend → API → database flow.

**JD Relevance**: Demonstrates microservice architecture, secure payment flows, and cloud deployment.

## Slide 4: Security Features

**Title**: Embedded Security Practices  
**Content**:

- **OWASP Top 10 Mitigation**:
    - XSS: Content Security Policy (CSP), input sanitization.
    - SQL Injection: Parameterized queries for transaction data.
    - Broken Authentication: Secure JWT with short expiration.
    - CSRF: Tokens for transfer forms.
- **WAF Simulation**: Go middleware to block malicious inputs (e.g., SQL injection, XSS patterns).
- **Fraud Detection**: Basic checks (e.g., transfer amount limits, unusual activity flags).
- **Secure Headers**: HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- **Audit Logging**: Logs for logins, transfers, and payments.
- **Testing**: `gosec` (SAST), OWASP ZAP (DAST), Trivy (container scanning).  
    **Visual**:
- Checklist of security features with checkmarks.
- Example: Code snippet of Go middleware for WAF or fraud check.

**JD Relevance**: Covers WAF, penetration testing, audit logging, and secure SDLC.

## Slide 5: DevSecOps Pipeline

**Title**: Automating Security with CI/CD  
**Content**:

- **Tool**: GitHub Actions.
- **Pipeline Steps**:
    - Static Analysis: `go vet`, `gosec` for code vulnerabilities.
    - Build: Compile Go app.
    - Test: Unit tests for API endpoints (e.g., transfer logic).
    - Container Scanning: Trivy for Docker image vulnerabilities.
- **Outcome**: Ensures continuous security checks for financial app.  
    **Visual**:
- Flowchart: Code Push → Static Analysis → Build → Test → Scan → Deploy.
- GitHub Actions logo + Trivy logo.

**JD Relevance**: Aligns with SAST, SCA, and secure SDLC requirements.  
**Memory Note**: Incorporates GitHub Actions and Trivy, aligning with your prior interest in DevSecOps pipelines.

## Slide 6: Deployment Flow

**Title**: Cloud-Native Deployment  
**Content**:

- **Containerization**: Dockerized Go app with minimal base image.
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (Minikube locally or AWS EKS).
- **Cloud Option**: AWS ECS for simpler deployment.
- **Security**: Trivy scans for container vulnerabilities; secrets management for API keys.
- **Process**: Build Docker image → Push to AWS ECR → Deploy to cluster.  
    **Visual**:
- Diagram: Docker Image → ECR (AWS) → Kubernetes Cluster → Running Pods.
- AWS and Kubernetes logos.

**JD Relevance**: Demonstrates Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS knowledge.

## Slide 7: Interview Talking Points

**Title**: Showcasing Skills in Interviews  
**Content**:

- **Secure Coding**: “Used parameterized queries to secure transaction data.”
- **OWASP Top 10**: “Implemented CSP and CSRF tokens to protect transfer forms.”
- **Payment Security**: “Built a mock payment flow with fraud checks, simulating Stripe integration.”
- **S-SDLC**: “Integrated `gosec` and Trivy in CI/CD for continuous security.”
- **WAF**: “Developed middleware to block SQL injection and XSS attempts.”
- **Cloud Security**: “Deployed to Kubernetes with scanned Docker images and secrets management.”
- **Tip**: Demo the app locally or share GitHub repo with a detailed README.  
    **Visual**:
- Bullet points with icons (e.g., bank for fintech, lock for security).
- Mock interview question: “How did you secure the payment flow in your project?”

**JD Relevance**: Prepares you to discuss JD skills, especially payment gateway integration.

## Flow Diagram: System & Data Flow

**Title**: System Architecture & Data Flow  
**Content**:  
Text-based representation of the fintech system’s data flow, showing component interactions.

```
[User] --> [Frontend (HTML Templates: Login, Dashboard, Transfer)]
                     |
                     v
[Security Middleware (WAF, Headers, Logging, Fraud Check)]
                     |
                     v
[Backend API (Go: Auth, Accounts, Transfers, Payments)]
                     |
                     v
[Database (SQLite: Users, Transactions)]
                     |
                     v
[CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions: gosec, Trivy)]
                     |
                     v
[Docker Container] --> [Kubernetes/AWS]
```

**Explanation**:

- **User**: Interacts with frontend (e.g., submits transfer form).
- **Frontend**: Sends HTTP requests to API (e.g., POST /transfer).
- **Middleware**: Filters requests (WAF), adds headers, logs events, checks for fraud.
- **API**: Processes requests, queries database for balances or transactions.
- **Database**: Stores user accounts and transaction history securely.
- **CI/CD**: Builds, tests, and scans code/containers for vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment**: Runs app in Docker/Kubernetes/AWS, handling financial workloads.

**JD Relevance**: Visualizes microservice architecture, secure payment flows, and DevSecOps integration.
